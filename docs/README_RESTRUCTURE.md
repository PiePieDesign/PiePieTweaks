# Proposed README Structure

1. **Project Overview**
   - Concise description of the custom nodes and the problems they solve.
   - High-level feature list for quick scanning.

2. **Quick Start**
   - Supported ComfyUI version(s) and prerequisites.
   - One-line install via ComfyUI Manager followed by manual installation steps.
   - Link to example workflows.

3. **Node Catalogue**
   - Individual subsections per node with a consistent template:
     - Problem solved.
     - Key features.
     - Input/Output summary tables.
     - Usage tips or caveats.

4. **Model Requirements**
   - Centralized table covering all required/optional weights with download links, expected sizes, and target directories.
   - Notes on VRAM considerations or compatible hardware.

5. **Usage Examples**
   - Animated GIF or screenshots of UI interactions where helpful.
   - Step-by-step walkthrough for representative workflows (e.g., LucidFlux restoration pipeline).

6. **Troubleshooting**
   - Common error messages and recovery steps (missing models, insufficient VRAM, etc.).
   - Guidance on enabling debug logging.

7. **Contributing**
   - Coding guidelines, testing expectations, and issue/PR templates.
   - Pointers to improvement ideas listed in `docs/IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

8. **License & Credits**
   - Explicit MIT license reference.
